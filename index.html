        <li>Delivered a project that added caching to Bitbucket's public <a href="https://developer.atlassian.com/bitbucket/api/2/reference/resource/repositories/%7Bworkspace%7D/%7Brepo_slug%7D/diff/%7Bspec%7D">Diff</a> and <a href="https://developer.atlassian.com/bitbucket/api/2/reference/resource/repositories/%7Bworkspace%7D/%7Brepo_slug%7D/diffstat/%7Bspec%7D">Diffstat</a> APIs, allowing users to view their pull requests much faster with a 5-10x reduction in API response times and lightened the load on the infrastructure with a 25% reduction in NFS usage</li>
        <li>Led the "Tasks" feature in Bitbucket's <a href="https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/try-the-new-pull-request-experience-in-bitbucket-958455255.html" target="_blank">new Pull Request UI</a>, which was the top request from users at the time. It provided new workflows that allowed users to author and review pull requests in a more structured manner</li>
        <li>Shipped improvements to Bitbucket's Diff API that allowed it to process diffs that contained massive amounts of changes - previously customers would have to review these changes locally as the API would time-out or throw an error in this situation</li>
        <li>Frequently contributed to Bitbucket's internal Python library that is used for interacting with Git at a low level - mainly focused on bug fixes that came from customer support cases</li>
        <li>Built internal tooling to automate recurring manual tasks related to customer support, saving time for software engineers, support engineers, and several customers</li>
        <li>Contributed to Atlassian's open source <a href="https://bitbucket.org/atlassianlabs/atlascode/src/main/">VScode extension</a> to address an inconsistency between Bitbucket's pull request UI and the extension's pull request viewer that came up in a customer support case</li>

        <li>Owned and shipped a new version of Bitbucket's Repository Branches page to a React-based SPA, improving the page performance and experience for over 200,000 daily users</li>
        <li>Led a team contractors to ship new versions of pages on Bitbucket to the React SPA architecture, including the Commit List, Pull Request List, and Repository List. This significantly sped up the user experience as navigating between different pages no longer required a full reload</li>
        <li>Developed several new internal APIs in the Python/Django backend to support the technical and performance requirements of the new React pages</li>
